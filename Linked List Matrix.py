To solve this problem, we need to construct a 2D linked list representation of the given matrix. Each element in the matrix will be a node in the linked list, and each node will have four pointers: right (pointing to the next element in the same row), down (pointing to the next element in the same column), and optionally left and up (though we will only use right and down here to maintain simplicity). 

Let's first define a `Node` class for the linked list:

### Node Definition:
Each node contains:
- `data`: the value of the matrix element.
- `right`: the pointer to the next node in the same row.
- `down`: the pointer to the next node in the same column.

### Approach:
1. First, create the `Node` class.
2. Traverse the matrix to create the corresponding nodes.
3. Link the nodes horizontally (right pointers) and vertically (down pointers).

class Solution:
    def constructLinkedMatrix(self, mat):
        if not mat or not mat[0]:
            return None
        
        n = len(mat)
        # Create a 2D array to hold the pointers to the nodes
        node_matrix = [[None for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Initialize the nodes for the entire matrix
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                node_matrix[i][j] = Node(mat[i][j])
        
        # Set the right and down pointers for each node
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if j < n - 1:
                    node_matrix[i][j].right = node_matrix[i][j + 1]  # Link to the next node in the row
                if i < n - 1:
                    node_matrix[i][j].down = node_matrix[i + 1][j]  # Link to the next node in the column
        
        # The head of the linked list will be the node at (0, 0)
        return node_matrix[0][0]

### Explanation:
1. **Node class**: This class holds the data of each matrix element and pointers to the right and down nodes.
2. **constructLinkedMatrix**: 
   - We first create a 2D array (`node_matrix`) of `Node` objects corresponding to each matrix element.
   - Then, we link the nodes horizontally (using the `right` pointer) and vertically (using the `down` pointer).
   - Finally, the head node of the linked list is returned, which is located at `node_matrix[0][0]`.
3. **printLinkedMatrix**: This function prints the 2D linked list by traversing row by row.



This implementation achieves the desired time and space complexity of O(nÂ²).
