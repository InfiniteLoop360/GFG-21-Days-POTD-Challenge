'''
Given a sorted array arr[] of positive integers, find the smallest positive integer such that it cannot be represented as the sum of elements of any subset of the given array set.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 7
Explanation: 7 is the smallest positive number for which no subset is there with sum 7.
Input: arr[] = [3, 6, 9, 10, 20, 28]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the smallest positive number for which no subset is there with sum 1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### Problem Breakdown:
The problem asks to find the smallest positive integer that **cannot** be represented as the sum of elements of any subset of a given sorted array of positive integers.

### Approach:
The problem can be solved using a **greedy approach**. Here's a detailed breakdown of the thought process:

#### Insight:
- **Key Idea**: Suppose we've already constructed all possible sums up to some value `x` using subsets of the array's elements. If the next element in the array is greater than `x + 1`, we cannot construct `x + 1` because the next element is too large to fill the gap.
  
- For example:
  - If we have constructed sums up to 6, and the next element in the array is 8, we cannot construct the sum 7, as no combination of previously considered elements can reach 7, and 8 is too large.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Start by assuming the smallest number we can't represent is `1`.
2. **Iterate through the array**: 
   - If the current element of the array is greater than `x` (the smallest number we can't represent), then `x` is the answer because we can't form `x` with the given elements.
   - If the current element is less than or equal to `x`, it means we can extend the range of representable sums by adding this element to previous sums.
3. **Final Output**: Once we complete the iteration, if all elements have been processed without finding a gap, the next value of `x` is the smallest number that can't be represented.

#### Time Complexity:
- Since we only traverse the array once, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a few variables to keep track of the sums.

class Solution:
    def findSmallest(self, arr):
        # Initialize the smallest number that cannot be represented
        smallest_cannot_represent = 1
        
        # Traverse the array
        for num in arr:
            # If current number is greater than the smallest number that can't be represented
            if num > smallest_cannot_represent:
                break
            
            # Otherwise, update the smallest number that cannot be represented
            smallest_cannot_represent += num
        
        return smallest_cannot_represent

'''
### Explanation of Code:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize `smallest_cannot_represent` to 1 because we start by assuming the smallest positive number that cannot be represented is 1.
  
2. **Loop through the array**:
   - If the current number in the array is greater than `smallest_cannot_represent`, this means we have found the smallest number that cannot be represented (since the current number is too large to form this sum).
   - Otherwise, we can include the current number in the sum, so we add it to `smallest_cannot_represent`, extending the range of representable sums.

3. **Return the result**: Once we exit the loop, `smallest_cannot_represent` will contain the smallest number that cannot be represented as a sum of the subset of the array.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`
- **Step-by-Step**:
  - Start with `smallest_cannot_represent = 1`.
  - First element is 1, and it's <= 1, so add it to `smallest_cannot_represent`. Now, `smallest_cannot_represent = 2`.
  - Second element is 2, and it's <= 2, so add it to `smallest_cannot_represent`. Now, `smallest_cannot_represent = 4`.
  - Third element is 3, and it's <= 4, so add it to `smallest_cannot_represent`. Now, `smallest_cannot_represent = 7`.
  - No more elements left, so the smallest number that cannot be represented is 7.
- **Output**: 7

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `arr = [3, 6, 9, 10, 20, 28]`
- **Step-by-Step**:
  - Start with `smallest_cannot_represent = 1`.
  - First element is 3, and it's > 1, so we can't form 1.
- **Output**: 1

### Conclusion:
This approach leverages a greedy strategy to efficiently find the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as the sum of a subset of the given array. The solution runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** space, making it optimal for this problem.
